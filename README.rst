What the heck is this?
======================

`Crammit` is a small tool that provides both CSS and JavaScript
concatenation, compression and some other asset management related
goodies. If you've heard of Jammit for Rails then you can think of it
as my attempt to provide a similar simple version in Python.

Installation
------------

::

    $ [sudo] pip install crammit

If you're adventurous you can install a bleeding edge version from
the git master branch:

::

    $ [sudo] pip install git+https://github.com/rspivak/crammit.git#egg=crammit

To install in development mode

::

    $ git clone https://github.com/rspivak/crammit.git
    $ python setup.py develop
